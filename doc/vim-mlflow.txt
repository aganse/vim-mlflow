A Vim plugin to view in Vim the tables and info one sees in an MLFlow website


With many thanks to the Writing Vim plugin in Python article by Timur Rubeko at
http://candidtim.github.io/vim/2017/08/11/write-vim-plugin-in-python.html


Referring to this plugin in your .vimrc file:

* For normal users not developing/tweaking the plugin:
  `Plugin 'aganse/vim-mlflow'`

* For those who cloned the repo locally and want to tweak/dev further, use
  the file:// protocol with absolute path, like this for example:
  `Plugin 'file:///Users/aganse/Documents/src/python/vim-mlflow'`
