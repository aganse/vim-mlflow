*vim-mlflow.txt*	For Vim version 8.2+ and Neovim v0.11.5+	Last change: 2025 Dec 16

				*vim-mlflow*
vim-mlflow is a Vim/Neovim plugin for browsing MLflow experiments, runs,
metrics, parameters, tags, and artifacts without leaving your editor.  It
provides a sidebar for navigation and an optional comparison window for marked
runs.

==============================================================================
1. Overview						 *vim-mlflow-overview*

vim-mlflow surfaces MLflow tracking data directly inside Vim.  The plugin:
  - Lists experiments and runs in a dedicated sidebar buffer (`__MLflow__`).
  - Shows run details (parameters, metrics, tags, artifacts) inline.
  - Plots metric histories as ASCII graphs inside Vim splits.
  - Opens a secondary window (`__MLflowRuns__`) to compare multiple runs.

The project focuses on correctness and low maintenance overhead.  Features that
require extensive configuration or background services are intentionally kept
limited.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements & install				 *vim-mlflow-install*

vim-mlflow needs a Python-enabled Vim or Neovim and the MLflow Python package.

Minimum supported versions
  - Vim 8.2 compiled with `+python3`
  - Neovim v0.11.5 with the `pynvim` package installed

Python environment
  1. Create or activate a virtual environment (recommended):
	`python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
  2. Install MLflow (and pynvim for Neovim users):
	`pip install mlflow`
	`pip install pynvim`

Plugin install
  - Plugin managers: `Plugin 'aganse/vim-mlflow'`
  - Manual runtimepath example (Neovim): `set runtimepath+=/path/to/vim-mlflow`

After installation, restart Vim so the plugin is sourced.

==============================================================================
3. Getting started						*vim-mlflow-start*

Basic setup in your `vimrc`/`init.vim`:
>
	let g:mlflow_tracking_uri = 'http://localhost:5000'
	let g:vim_mlflow_width = 70
<
Launch the UI with either the default mapping or a command:
  - Default mapping: `<Leader>m` (typically `\m`)
  - Command form: `:call RunMLflow()`

Make sure your Vim session runs inside a Python environment where `mlflow` (and
`pynvim`, if needed) is installed; otherwise the plugin cannot connect.

==============================================================================
4. Windows & navigation					*vim-mlflow-windows*

Sidebar (`__MLflow__`)
  - Lists experiments, runs, and run details.
  - Sections for parameters, metrics, tags, and artifacts can be toggled.
  - Uses scroll hints and highlighting to show the active experiment/run.

Runs window (`__MLflowRuns__`)
  - Optional comparison buffer opened with `R` inside the sidebar.
  - Displays a tabular view of marked runs, including tags/params/metrics based
    on the toggles you choose.

Metric plots
  - Press `o` or `<Enter>` on metrics marked with `[final value; o to plot]` to
    open an ASCII graph in a vertical split.  Plots reuse a dedicated buffer by
    default but can be configured to open new windows for each metric.

Artifacts
  - Expand directories and open supported artifacts (text, JSON, YAML, MLmodel)
    directly inside Vim.  Binary artifacts are listed but stay unopened.

==============================================================================
5. Key mappings						*vim-mlflow-mappings*

Default mappings in the sidebar buffer (`__MLflow__`):

  `?`		Toggle the inline help banner.
  `<Enter>`	Open the experiment/run/section under the cursor.
  `o`		Same as `<Enter>`; also plots metrics where available.
  `<Space>`	Mark or unmark the highlighted run (visible in the runs window).
  `r`		Refresh the sidebar and reset expanded artifacts.
  `R`		Open or refresh the marked runs window (`__MLflowRuns__`).
  `<C-p>`	Toggle the Parameters section visibility.
  `<C-e>`	Toggle the Metrics section visibility.
  `<C-t>`	Toggle the Tags section visibility.
  `<C-a>`	Toggle the Artifacts section visibility.
  `@`		Rotate the order of detail sections (params/metrics/tags/artifacts).
  `A`		Cycle Active → Deleted → All experiments/runs (MLflow view type).
  `n` / `p`	Scroll the experiment or run list down / up.
  `N` / `P`	Jump to the bottom / top of the current list.

Default mappings in the runs window (`__MLflowRuns__`):

  `?`		Toggle the window-specific help banner.
  `R`		Refresh the listing of marked runs.
  `.`		Collapse or expand the column under the cursor.
  `x`		Remove the run under the cursor from the marked list.
  `<C-u>`	Undo all column layout tweaks (collapse/hide/move).
  `<C-p>`	Include or omit run parameters in the table.
  `<C-e>`	Include or omit run metrics in the table.
  `<C-t>`	Include or omit run tags in the table.

All mappings are buffer-local; redefining them globally is unnecessary.  You can
remap the entry point by adjusting your own `<Leader>` mapping or calling
`RunMLflow()` explicitly.

==============================================================================
6. Configuration						*vim-mlflow-config*

Only `g:mlflow_tracking_uri` is required.  Common options:

  `g:vim_mlflow_width`		Sidebar width in columns (default 70).
  `g:vim_mlflow_height`		Runs window height in rows (default 10).
  `g:vim_mlflow_expts_length`	Number of experiments displayed at once (default 8).
  `g:vim_mlflow_runs_length`	Number of runs displayed at once (default 8).
  `g:vim_mlflow_icon_useunicode`	Use Unicode box-drawing/icons (default 0 for ASCII).
  `g:vim_mlflow_plot_width` / `g:vim_mlflow_plot_height`
				Dimensions of metric plots (default 70x25).
  `g:vim_mlflow_plot_reuse_buffer`	Reuse a single plot buffer (default 1).
  `g:vim_mlflow_section_order`	List order for run details (default
				`['params', 'metrics', 'tags', 'artifacts']`).
  `g:vim_mlflow_timeout`	HTTP timeout (seconds) when probing the tracking URI
				before querying MLflow (default 0.5).

See `doc/configuration_params.md` in the repository for a complete table of
settings, including highlight groups and custom icon characters.

7. Troubleshooting & tips			*vim-mlflow-troubleshooting*

Slow refreshes~
  Each refresh queries MLflow synchronously.  Performance is best when Vim runs
  close to the tracking server.  Increase `g:vim_mlflow_timeout` if connections
  are flaky.  Long round-trips may still block Vim temporarily.

Unicode glyph issues~
  Set `let g:vim_mlflow_icon_useunicode = 0` to fall back to ASCII characters if
  your terminal font lacks box-drawing support.  Individual icons can also be
  overridden in your config.

Plugin does not load~
  - Confirm Vim reports `+python3` (`vim --version | grep +python3`).
  - In Neovim ensure `pynvim` is installed in the same environment.
  - From Vim run `:py3 import mlflow` to verify MLflow is importable.

Neovim layout wrapping~
  Neovim enables line wrapping by default.  Add `setlocal nowrap` in your config
  if columns in vim-mlflow buffers appear misaligned.

Artifacts~
  Text artifacts (`*.txt`, `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `MLmodel`) open directly.  Binary
  artifacts are listed but not opened.
